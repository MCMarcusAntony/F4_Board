This reposity contains PCB and Gerber files, as well as pictures and the schematics for the F4 register board
designed by Kamil Karimov. The board can be installed on top or below the Z80 processor of an MSX system to
support the F4 register for MSX2+ conversion.

Mr. Karimov gave his permission to put his files into the repository. However it's not allowed to use any of the
files in this repository for commercial purposes without the permission from the author. Making a small batch of
boards, using some of the boards for personal projects and selling the remaining boards is permitted.
